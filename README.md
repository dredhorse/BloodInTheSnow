## Welcome to my new Hackintosh Build

Hi, please pardon the dust till my hardware arrives. I will update this documentation with a build log of how I did build my BloodInTheSnow Hackintosh and a work log on how to install OSX Catalina and Windows 10 on this system afterwards.

And finally I will have a install log on how to install OSX Catalina on my hardware.
