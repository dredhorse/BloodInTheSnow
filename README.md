# SnowWhite, a hackintosh story

## Welcome to my new Hackintosh Build

Hi, please pardon the dust till my hardware arrives. I will update this documentation with a build log of how I did build my SnowWhite Hackintosh and a work log on how to install OSX Catalina and Windows 10 on this system afterwards.

And finally I will have an install log on how to install OSX Catalina on my hardware.

I will keep the information here updated and create additional documents if the need arises due to updates, patches, changes etc.

A copy of this will also be available on [https://dredhorse.github.io/SnowWhite/](https://dredhorse.github.io/SnowWhite/)

### The Hardware

Hardware is always an issue with a Hackintosh. If you don't get hardware which is supported by Apple directly with drivers there is no way to make it work. One of the reason why certain Wireless / Bluetooth Cards are so popular and why NVidia GPU don't work anymore after High Sierra.

The core hardware components can be found in [The Hackintosh itself](the-hardware/the-hackintosh-itself.md)

The customised water-cooling components can be found in [The Waterworks](the-hardware/the-waterworks.md) 

And there is also management, for heat / cooling and the laser shows which can be found in [The Brain](the-hardware/the-brain.md)

### Build Log

As the hardware is finally there, not complete but at least enough to figure out what is missing let's go.

### Work Log

The work log will start here

### Install Log

The install log will start here

### This and that

In this area you can find some information which is related to SnowWhite but can't directly be put under the other chapters. Some of it is still work in progress so tread lightly. Get a closer look in [here.](this-and-that/whats-in-here.md)
