# Assembling the Build

So let's start getting all the parts together.

## Radiators and Fans

I started with figuring out in which mode to use the fans and how to mount the radiators. My take on this atm is:

* Bottom: Pull to get fresh air in
* Side: Pull to get fresh air and have hopefully some movement of air in the drive cages [\(see the Case Review\)](../this-and-that/lianli-o11-dynamics-xl-review/airflow-in-the-lianli-o11-dynamics-xl.md)
* Top: Push to get the heat out
* Back: Push to get the heat out

There is one major drawback with this setup if you do RGB fans... most fans only have RGB to the front. Some of them look quite ok like the ones I use, and some are even better like the Corsair iCUE QL120 RGB but those are neither fans for radiators nor are they supported in a decent way with farbwerk360. The static pressure might not be that big issue as the fans I have atm are not that great either but the limitation with the farbwerk360 is. So if you go full corsair you might take a look into the above mentioned fans too.
