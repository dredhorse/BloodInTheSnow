# Modding the Build

You might not call it modding directly, but I did some not so normal things with the Build so let's put it here.

## Foot USB Connectors

The Dynamic XL has 2 USB Connectors in the right foot of the case. As I'm quite old and stiff \(not really\)  and the connectors are so far down I removed the cables from inside the case and put them under it. I didn't wanted to cut them off, you never know.

## Fans

I mean you know, I'm not being paid by corsair to do advertisement and it is a Hackintosh with the name of SnowWhite.

So I organized some nice stickers from StickerMule \(I can only highly recommend them, if they don't have what you need create an order and add your request to the comments. I got 2 different sizes of my stickers which they amended to fit correctly and I did only request 20 of each\).

I added some bigger ones to the backside of the fan hub and smaller ones to the front.

## Closing Air Gaps

Like discussed in the [case review](../this-and-that/lianli-o11-dynamics-xl-review/airflow-in-the-lianli-o11-dynamics-xl.md) I am concerned about how much air I will pull from areas I don't want or push into areas I don't want. So I organized some Polystyrol in white, cut it to size and used double sided tape to keep it in place.

## Cable Sleeves

Real custom cables are on the project list for next year, and I think they will be needed.

But to keep the cables in place, especially the fans are a pain because of the 2 cables per fan, I used some self closing wrap around white cable sleeves.

Keeping the case nice and tidy.

## Footers

I got magnetic mounts for M3 screws which I screwed under all the Aqua Computer components. That makes it a lot easier to position them as the case is made from steel.
