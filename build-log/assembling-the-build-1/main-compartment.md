## Fans and Radiators

After deciding on how to [configure the fans](../assembling-the-build.md#radiators-and-fans) I installed them in the correct orientation and sleeved the cables.

After that I added my custom stickers from StickerMule.

Than I assembled the pump and the reservoir. I already added the light strip to the reservoir which was a mistake.

When trying to add the mount for the reservoir to the radiator through the fans it became easily clear I had 2 problems:

1\) the length of the screws \(3 cm\)

2\) the diameter of the screws \(m4\)

I guessed that I either need 3,5 cm or 4 cm long screws, they needed to be m4 because that is the size of the holes in the radiator. So I went out to get 4 of them each. For good measurement I also wanted to get some washer if needed. Quite an odessy unfortunatly as I couldn't get them in the same shop.

After returning with the correct screws I did need to widen the holes in the mounting kit as they were for m3 screws.

After doing that I found out that the heads of the screws I got where to big to get into the holes of the mounting bracket to I needed the 4 cm screws in the end.

For a redo of the build I will try to get some m4 3,5 screws in black with a smaller head, for now it has to work.

During test mounting of the radiators with fans it became quite obvious that the case is quite tight with so much parts in it. To be able to access the inlet and outlets of the radiators and the pumpt I needed 45 or 90 degree fittings, otherwise I would end up with kinks in my tubing.
