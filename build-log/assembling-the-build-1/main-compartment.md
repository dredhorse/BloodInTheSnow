# Main Compartment

## Fans and Radiators

After deciding on how to [configure the fans](../assembling-the-build.md#radiators-and-fans) I installed them in the correct orientation and sleeved the cables.

After that I added my custom stickers from StickerMule.

Then I assembled the pump and the reservoir. I already added the light strip to the reservoir which was a mistake, as you need to slide it onto the mount, which isn't possible if the light strip is already installed.

When trying to add the mount for the reservoir to the radiator through the fans it became easily clear I had 2 problems:

1\) the length of the screws \(3 cm\)

2\) the diameter of the screws \(m4\)

I guessed that I either need 3,5 cm or 4 cm long screws, they needed to be m4 because that is the size of the holes in the radiator. So I went out to get 4 of them each. For good measurement I also wanted to get some washer if needed. Quite an odessy unfortunately as I couldn't get them in the same shop.

After returning with the correct screws I did need to widen the holes in the mounting kit as they were for m3 screws.

After doing that I found out that the heads of the screws I got where too big to get into the holes of the mounting bracket to I needed the 4 cm screws in the end.

For a redo of the build I will try to get some m4 3,5 screws in black with a smaller head, for now it has to work.

## Tubing

During test mounting of the radiators with fans it became quite obvious that the case is quite tight with so much parts in it. To be able to access the inlet and outlets of the radiators and the pump I needed 45 or 90 degree fittings, otherwise I would end up with kinks in my tubing.

I already purchased some 45 degree fittings but I needed a lot more. In the end I think the tubing worked out quite ok.

I got the S-Bend done nicely by using some famous danish building blocks, using a silicon bending tube you normally use for rigid tubing and heating up the tube in around 50 to 60 degree warm water.

I put the tube in place and then cooled it down again. At the moment it looks quite good, I hope it will hold to gravity and coolant. If this doesn't work I have some other options in making this work, but of course it will require draining the system first.

After finalising the tubing I went to start

## Air Pressure Leak Testing

As described in  [Air Pressure Leak Testing](../../this-and-that/lessons-learned.md#air-pressure-leak-testing) I had quite some issues with testing my tubing as the reservoir was leaking air at the top. 

After some fiddling around I was able to hold the pressure for longer than 15 minutes. So I wanted to start the real test.

## Filling of the Tubes

Before I could start filling the tubes with coolant I found an issue with the[ D5 next pump](../../this-and-that/aquacomputer.md#d5-next-pump). I couldn't supply it with power.

So I went and started working on the [Side Compartment.](side-compartment.md)

After the sata power extension arrived I finished connection up the pump. A little issue is that the sata power connector keeps on disconnecting when there is a pull on the cable, will need to figure out if it works or if I need to find a solution for it.

But now for finally filling the tubes.
