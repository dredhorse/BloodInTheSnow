# Side Compartment

## Monitoring and Control

To fasten all the different components which need to go into the side compartment I went for magnet m4 compatible "feet".

I added them to all of the components and put them in a place already, needing afterwards to check if they are in the right position based on cable length.

During the time I was waiting for the sata power extension and a molex splitter I started laying out the cables and connecting all the parts. During this I moved some components around.

I also documented the everything and labeled the cables a little bit to have it afterwards easier to figure out which connection is which. That should be prove valuable during configuration of the system in the Aquasuite.

## Power Cables

The PSU comes with white cables. Unfortunately those are not just normal white cables with combs but cables put into round cable sleeves. And the cables for the GPU are even a Y-splitted cable at the end.

That doesn't really look that nice for the GPU and mainboard.

As the next project will be customised cables I won't pay for additional cables from CableMod, I will have to live with it.
