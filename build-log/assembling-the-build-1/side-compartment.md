# Side Compartment

## Monitoring and Control

To fasten all the different components which need to go into the side compartment I went for magnet m4 compatible "feet".

I added them to all of the components and put them in a place already, needing afterwards to check if they are in the right position based on cable length.

During the time I was waiting for the sata power extension and a molex splitter I started laying out the cables and connecting all the parts. During this I moved some components around.

I also documented the everything and labeled the cables a little bit to have it afterwards easier to figure out which connection is which. That should be prove valuable during configuration of the system in the Aquasuite.
