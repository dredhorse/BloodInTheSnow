The Waterworks and Show effects could be managed by the motherboard itself, as it has all the required features like enough fan connectors, customised fan curves etc.

As the motherboard is controlling it there wouldn't also any issue between running OSX or Windows.

But because I wanted a challenge and I tend to over-engineer it will be managed by the following components:
