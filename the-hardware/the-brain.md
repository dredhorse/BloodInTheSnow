# The Brain

The Waterworks and Show effects could be managed by the motherboard itself, as it has all the required features like enough fan connectors, customized fan curves, extra temperature sensors etc.

As the motherboard is controlling it there wouldn't also any issue between running OSX or Windows. But configuration would need to be done in BIOS or in Windows. It would also require an additional temperature sensor inside the water-cooling loop hooked up to the motherboard.

But because I wanted a challenge and I tend to over-engineer, it will be managed by the following components:
