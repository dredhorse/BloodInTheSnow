# Lessons Learned

Ok, here a list of some lessons learned along the way:

## Custom Watercooling

Probably best way to approach custom watercooling is the following:

1. Inform yourself about Custom Watercooling \(obvious I know\)
2. Figure out how many radiators you will need for the build you would like to do. Size and thickness does matter, radiator thickness should be fine around 3 - 4 cm
3. Find a nice case which will fit your parts
4. Decide on which other parts you would want
5. Order case, motherboard, RAM, graphicscard, reservoir, pump, radiators and fans \(at least one per radiator plus one spare if you need to save a little bit of money in the beginning\)
6. Wait till all the stuff is there
7. Make sure that all radiators with fans mounted will fit the case together with the motherboard
8. Try to figure out where and how to position reservoir and pump
9. Try to envision how your tubes will flow \(no pun intended\)
10. Order rest of the parts included needed tubes and fittings

I personally did point 7 - 10 before I had the case which lead to a lot of redesign and some after orders and returns mainly on the fittings side.

## Theme for the Build

If you go for a black, white and some color theme  and don't care which part has which color you are save, go ahead.

If you want something special be prepared to pay a lot of money, wait ages or be disappointed that the parts you want don't even exist.

Especially if you want to have coloured parts for the custom watercooling, make sure before that the provider of the parts you will choose will support your theme. Also keep in mind that everybody seems to have a different definition of white, black, grey, red and so on. So mixing and matching might not be possible.
