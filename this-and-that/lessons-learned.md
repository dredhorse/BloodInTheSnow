# Lessons Learned

Ok, here a list of some lessons learned along the way:

## Custom Watercooling

Probably best way to approach custom watercooling is the following:

1. Inform yourself about Custom Watercooling \(obvious I know\)
2. Figure out how many radiators you will need for the build you would like to do. Size and thickness does matter, radiator thickness should be fine around 3 - 4 cm
3. Find a nice case which will fit your parts
4. Decide on which other parts you would want
5. Order case, motherboard, RAM, graphicscard, reservoir, pump, radiators and fans \(at least one per radiator plus one spare if you need to save a little bit of money in the beginning\)
6. Wait till all the stuff is there
7. Make sure that all radiators with fans mounted will fit the case together with the motherboard
8. Try to figure out where and how to position reservoir and pump
9. Try to envision how your tubes will flow \(no pun intended\)
10. Order rest of the parts included needed tubes and fittings

I personally did point 7 - 10 before I had the case which lead to a lot of redesign and some after orders and returns mainly on the fittings side.

## Air Pressure Testing

Air Pressure Testing is an easy and hassle free way to test if your build is leaking. I would still do a Wet Run in the end though.

* Get yourself an air pressure testing unit, either from EK or Aquacomputer or build your own. 
* 15 Minutes without loosing any air \(Do NOT use a high pressure to test\) means that normally the system is fine.
* Start Testing directly in the beginning with testing any component you want to use. 
* During building of the custom loop test those extensions to make sure they are safe.
* At the end do a final test of the full loop.

If air is leaking use some water with Dishwashing Liquid togehter Q-Tips or similar to find any leaks.

## Theme for the Build

If you go for a black, white and some color theme  and don't care which part has which color you are save, go ahead.

If you want something special be prepared to pay a lot of money, wait ages or be disappointed that the parts you want don't even exist.

Especially if you want to have coloured parts for the custom watercooling, make sure before that the provider of the parts you will choose will support your theme. Also keep in mind that everybody seems to have a different definition of white, black, grey, red and so on. So mixing and matching might not be possible.

## You need more time and parts than you think

Even if you plan ahead, if you are not one of the specialised shops for custom watercooling or creating time-lapsed youtube videos you will need additional time and parts.

I needed to buy additional screws to mount the reservoir mount to the radiator via the fans. 

INSERT PIC HERE  
Not only where the screws supplied with the mounts m3 and the radiator required m4, they where also quite short. I measured the original screws and they where 3 cm long. So I decided to buy 4 x 3.5 cm and 4 x 4 cm screws including some washers.

In the end, after drilling m4 holes into the mounts, I needed the 4 cm screws because they are resting on top of the mount, not internally. Sinking them isn't really an option because than I would need to use washers between mount and fans.

Oh and did I already say that the first shop I went to only had 4 cm screws and washers?

Similar did happen with the fittings and cables for the AquaComputer parts. I didn't notice when ordering that there where no connection cables between the pump, cpu cooler and flow meter to the aquaero supplied.

## Order of Assembly

The order of Assembly is quite important. Not in the obvious way like first CPU into CPU Socket and than the Cooler.

No, more in the way of figuring out the limiting factors first by doing a test positioning of components and than focussing on those limiting factors first.

So you put the cooler on the CPU but don't use the cooling paste yet, as we will remove it again.

So try to position all components and if you find limits during this part directly try to find a solution for them. 

Than with the components in place try to simulate cable and tube flow. Are the cables long enough? Will a tube kink? So make all of this work, either by repositioning the tubes and cables or by getting longer tubes and cables.

Also directly start looking for which part of tubing and cableing comes first, which after that and so on.

And of course you should now notice the hard spaces where you can't get to after you have put other things, might it be components, tubing or cableing in place.

Make yourself a list of steps with this information.

Did you find things which are questionable to implement?

Try them first, making sure that it will fit / work. Otherwise thing about a workaround or if possible just don't implement it. If you NEED to implement it take a step back and look at the issue again. Sometimes dropping some ideas will make it work. Sometimes putting things in different places or orientation will make it work. Sometimes the only way is to get a drill  or saw out and remove parts of the case. And sometimes..... well....  you need to start from scratch and get a total different component.

After you have done all this try it again. Again... nothing will be fully fixed now, just make sure it works.

Than you start the process for good. During all the following steps keep in mind  the ordered list of steps you created so that you don't put yourself into a tight corner, there are enough already.

Put the thermal paste on the cpu and attach the cooler correctly. Start with the tubeing and make sure that it can hold pressure.

Now attach all the cables. Keep in mind that labeled cables save you a lot of hassle in the long run.

Now fill the system with coolant and let the cooling part run for some time.

Than you can boot up your new computer.
