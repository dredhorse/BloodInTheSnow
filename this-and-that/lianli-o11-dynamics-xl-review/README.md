# LianLi O11 Dynamics XL Review

This is my personal review about the LianLi O11 Dynamics XL.

You will find that this review differs a lot when you take a look at all the other reviews which are out there. 

So let's take a look.

## My First Thoughts

I really liked the case when I was looking for a nice case to build my hackintosh in. I already had a nice LianLi full aluminium case ages ago and was quite fond of it. It is still in the cellar hosting a fileserver with all the harddrives needed.

But after I "bought" the case some concern did grow on me. Unfortunately I don't really have the time or the means I think to fully proof that I'm correct  but I can at least explain them and hope they make sense.

As they are quite a few and I tried to deliver a good work including pictures take a look [here.](airflow-in-the-lianli-o11-dynamics-xl.md)
