# LianLi O11 Dynamics XL Review

This is my personal review of the LianLi O11 Dynamics XL.

You will find that this review differs a lot when you take a look at all the other reviews which are out there. 

So let's take a look.

## My First Thoughts

I really liked the case when I was looking for a nice case to build my Hackintosh in. I already had a nice LianLi full aluminum case ages ago and was quite fond of it. It is still in the cellar hosting a fileserver with all the hard drives needed.

But after I "bought" the case some concern did grow on me. Unfortunately, I don't really have the time or the means to fully prove that I'm correct but I can at least explain them and hope they make sense.

As they are quite a few and I tried to deliver good work including pictures take a look [here.](airflow-in-the-lianli-o11-dynamics-xl.md)

## Build Quality / Looks

Very good and sturdy. You can't really complain about it.

It is a little bit weird to have the big opening in the bottom to have the bottom front usb connectors cable to be able to pass through completely. But it is understandable as that means they can just use a pre-manufactured cable and don't need to configure it after the put the cable in.

## Space

The case in itself has quite some space, but putting three 360 Radiators into it pushes it to capacity.

And I used slim radiators without push / pull.

If you don't have so many cables \(aka you are not using tons of RGB and electronics to control them\) the side compartment has a lot of space for you and will still look clean.

## My After the Build Thoughts

At the moment the temperatures in the drive area are kept at a difference of around .5 C from the outside temperature. I think that is fine, no big issues there as in my other cases which is a welcome change.

Other than that I can't complain at the moment. Time will tell.
