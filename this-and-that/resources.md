# Resources

A list of a lot of the resources I did use to create my Hackintosh.

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all of them are listed here, some of them are hidden in the rest of the documentation!
{% endhint %}

The whole build is based on [AudioGod's Aorus Z390 Master Patched DSDT EFI for Catalina Mini Guide and Discussion](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/340936-audiogods-aorus-z390-master-patched-dsdt-efi-for-catalina-mini-guide-and-discussion/) on InsanelyMac. Without it and the personal help of AudioGod it would have been a little bit harder to get this working.

I used 3 USB Boot Sticks, one for the Bios and Profiles, one for Windows 10, and one for the macOS install.

* Bios F11c from Gigabyte or AudioGod
* Custom Bios Profile for MSR unlock from AudiGod or a [DIY MSR Unlock](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/extras/msr-lock.html)
* OpenCore EFI Folder from OpenCore 058 Z390 Pro 1,1 040520 from AudioGod
* TINU from [https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU ](https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU%20)
* PlistEditPro from [https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/plisteditpro/](https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/plisteditpro/)
* GenSMBIOS from [https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
* MacSerial which can be automatically downloaded via GenSMBIOS
* Hackintool from [https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool)
* CloverConfigurator \(for mounting the EFI\) from [https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/)
* MountEFI \(an other option to mount EFI from shell\) from [https://github.com/Andrej-Antipov/MountEFI](https://github.com/Andrej-Antipov/MountEFI)
