# Whats in here?

So you have come to This and That.

I hope you find this information useful even if it is unpolished.

## Lessons Learned

I keep on learning with everything I do, and I like to share the [lessons I learned.](lessons-learned.md)

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some [Tips and Tricks](tips-and-tricks.md) which don't fit into Lessons Learned, also some links to other resources.

## Aqua Computer Components

Some information about the [Aqua Computer Components](aquacomputer/aquacomputer-in-general.md) I'm using which I find useful and wanted to share.

## LianLi O11 Dynamics XL Review

So what do I think about the case after I created a Hackintosh in it? [Find it out and be flubbergasted.](lianli-o11-dynamics-xl-review/)

## Why does the Steam Client fail with Disk Write Error on macOS Catalina

There are some issues with the Steam Client in macOS which I noticed because I was unable to install Cities:Skylines. Find out how I resolved the [mystery.](unable-to-update-cities-skylines-in-macos-catalina.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
This happened with Cities:Skylines but as it is an issue with the Steam Client it might happen with other games too.

## Tracking EFI folder in GIT

I started tracking the [EFI folder in GIT,](tracking-efi-folder-in-git.md) which helps keep a tab on changes and is in my opinion better than a zip file. 

## Gitbook and GitHub Pages

I will see if I try to keep pushing the documentation I create on Gitbook also to GitHub Pages, but you can at least find a way on how to create GitHub Pages with the command line Gitbook tools[ here.](using-gitbook-to-generate-the-documentation.md)

{% hint style="danger" %}
I stopped trying to go down this road as the gitbook cli tools are deprecated and also Jekyll has issues with processing the new syntax of GitBook. So only GitBook and normal GitHub.
