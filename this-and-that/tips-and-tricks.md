# Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks I would like to pass along, which I either found somewhere else or came up with by myself.

## Custom Cooling

* Screw in the fittings into the radiators before you mount them
* Use working cloves if you screw in the fittings
* Have enough 45 angled fittings available
* [Air Pressure Test during building](lessons-learned.md#air-pressure-testing), not at the end.
* You can bend softtube into "shape" by putting the tube into warm water \(above 50 degrees wouldn't go over the max temp of the tube though, which was 60 in my case\), putting it into shape and cooling it. With this you can also get straight tubes. Of course a softtube will sag due to gravity and the weight of the coolant but this can help to keep your tubes in shape.

## Cables

* Label the cables, this makes it a lot easier in the long run
* Keep similar cables and location together, this makes for a cleaner build even if the cables at the end have different length

## Parts

* Get a LED Strip for the Heatkiller Reservoir which is for a smaller size, if you have the correct size some led will be visible above the coolant.
