# Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks I would like to pass along, which I either found somewhere else or came up with by myself.

## Custom Cooling

* Screw in the fittings into the radiators before you mount them
* Use working cloves if you screw in the fittings
* Have enough 45 angled fittings available
* [Air Pressure Test during building](lessons-learned.md#air-pressure-testing), not at the end.

## Cables

* Label the cables, this makes it a lot easier in the long run
* Keep similar cables and location together, this makes for a cleaner build even if the cables at the end have different length
