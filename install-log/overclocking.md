# Overclocking

The following configuration is something which works on MY hackintosh.

It might not work on other systems and it might harm your computer.

## CPU Overclocking

I started with some save overclocking based on some information I found [here.](https://forums.bit-tech.net/index.php?threads/9900k-5ghz-1-2v-guide-gigabyte-z390-master.353729/)

I did do some old fashioned screen shots as the bios do differ a lot though.

### CPU?? Settings

CPU Vcore to Normal

Dynamic Vcore \(DVID\) +0,000V \(you might need to increase this by +0,010v till your system is stable\)

CPU Clock Ratio to 50

### Advanced CPU Core Settings

Intel Speed Shift \(Speedstep\) to enabled \(that should be the case\)

### Testing

Best done under windows as the tools are just better there.



## GPU Overclocking

Overclocking the PowerColor Liquid Devil is easy, it is Overclocked out of the box ðŸ˜€ At least if the Bios Setting is set to OC.

But you can even go faster by switching to the Unleashed Bios.

Nice video from [DerBauer ](https://youtu.be/n5t5mQCwrpU)about it. And some information from [overclockers.co.uk](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/powercolor-radeon-rx-5700-xt-liquid-devil-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-graphics-card-gx-19g-pc.html).
