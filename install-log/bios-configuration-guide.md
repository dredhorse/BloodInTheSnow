# Bios Configuration Guide

This chapter is about Bios Configuration. I did use the profile from Audiogood which also disables MSR directly but there are some changes I wanted and needed to do.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you can't boot into the bios anymore after making changes and see a weird Windows 7 or so boot screen which than boots into your Windows 10 you need to clear the bios and Disable the Above 4GB Decoding which is enabled in Audiogood's profile.
{% endhint %}
