# Windows 10

## Pre-Install

I configured the Bios based on the [Bios Configuration Guide.](bios-configuration-guide.md)

## Installing

I always start with installing Windows 10.

That allows me to check if all components work and a lot of software only work in Windows 10 which are required to configure the system like the RGB settings of the mainboard, ram, graphics card and of course AquaSuite.

I created the bootable usb stick with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) an other option would be [Unetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) .

Most other options like in terminal don't work anymore as the latest version of Windows 10 has files which are too big to copy, which can lead into errors which will pop up directly after selecting the install disk.

Normally I also disconnect all drives but in this case that is problematic as both boot media are M.2.

Luckily the Samsung 970 EVO Plus drive is around 500GB while the ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro is 512GB which makes it easy to figure out which drive is which.

After that I started installing Windows 10 onto the ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro M.2. Nothing special to it.

After you have installed Windows 10 there is not a lot to do.

## Post Install

### Taking care of Time Drift

Dualbooting Windows 10 and macOS will cause your time to drift. This is caused by different time standards which are being used in both OS.

You can disable this behaviour by configuring Windows correctly \(of course üòÄ \)

* Disable ‚ÄúSet Time automatically‚Äù in Time & Language
* Edit Registry
* HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation
* Create dword 32 bit RealTimeIsUniversal with value 1

### Bluetooth

If you want to have the Bluetooth of the MQUPIN fenvi T919 Wireless you need to install a driver \(the wifi part works out of the box\) [http://en.fenvi.com/en/download\_zx.php](http://en.fenvi.com/en/download_zx.php) 

### WiFi

I disabled the Intel WiFi in the Bios and the MQUPIN fenvi T919 Wireless works out of the box.
