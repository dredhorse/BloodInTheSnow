# Known Issues

And as always the ugly head of the medusa of bugs raises it's head

## General Issues

1. Strange Issues with Bios Problems, can't really figure out atm what is causing them, could be RAM not posting
2. Stream Deck keeps on pulsing after the computer is shutdown. It is connected to an USB Hub like most of my other devices. That hub is powered but the power is cut off when the computer shuts down via a master / slave extension cord. Looks like USB is still powered.

1. Getting a Crash in macOS with Sleep Mode: Sleep Wake failure in EFIFailure code:: 0xffffffff 0x0000001f
2. 


## Issues Windows

1. Aquasuite forgets names of Senors
